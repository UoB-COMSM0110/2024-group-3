IDEA 1 - endless runner
- 2d moving across the screen
- Avoiding obstacles e.g. jumping, ducking etc
- Avoiding projectiles/weapons/enemies that come towrads you
- Moving platforms
- Different levels e.g. moving up/down instead of sideways
- Powerups e.g. superjump/invincibility/size change
- Customisation: different characters, maps
- High score tracker
- Score over time, but coins increase score
- Could be live generating map - increase amount of objects over time
- Lose either if you hit an object, or screen catches up to you - undecided
Three challenges: collision detection, high score tracker, powerups, generation/storage of map
