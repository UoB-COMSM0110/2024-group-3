# Project ideas 

## 1. Endless Runner

  The game is a 2D "endless runner", where the player controls a character that moves left to right across the screen, avoiding obstacles (by jumping and ducking). The character has to avoid projectiles and enemies that come towards them, and jump across moving platforms. The goal could be to get as many coins as possible to increase your score, or to complete the level in the lowest time possible (or both: to be decided). A high score board keeps track of high scores. You lose either if you hit an object, or if the scrolling screen catches up to you (or both: to be decided). The player could customise the game with different characters and maps. The map could be generated live, adding more and more objects as time goes on, increasing the difficulty. 

### Twist
There could be a special level that moves vertically instead of horizontally. Also the character could pick up power-ups that change their abilities (e.g. invincibility) or size. 

### Challenges

- Collision detection
- Storing and displaying the high score
- Power-up mechanics 
- How is memory allocated for the map and how is it destroyed (when not needed)?

## 2. Survival/Sandbox  

The game is a survival/sandbox game, inspired by Minecraft but in 2D. You play as a character who has to fight off enemies and interact with the environment to gather resources and weapons. There are day and night cycles, and the character uses the daytime to prepare to fight enemies at night. The character has an inventory of limited size for items and weapons. There is a finite map with different zones to explore (for example jungle, ice, desert).  

### Twist

Perhaps the waves of enemies get more difficult over time.

### Challenges

- Enemy AI
- Graphics to differentiate between day/night and environments 
- Interaction with the map
